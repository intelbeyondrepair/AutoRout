This script automates going into my router
and forwarding a port.


I could not test if this works on any other router
There is a very low chance this code will
work on your router.

Installation:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
python3 Main.py

You will need a webdriver. I used Chromes Webdriver,
which i included.
